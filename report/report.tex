%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
        This project is the application of YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once) for detect and estimate calories and allergens in food item images.
        In order to address the growing demand of the health diet and allergens check, we use the object identification features of YOLO to recognize foods in pictures.
        To deliver precise calorie counts and allergen check, the model is trained on a dataset that contains images, nutritional data, and allergen information.
        The findings demonstrate the use of transfer learning and deep learning, providing a powerful tool for health-conscious customers and those dealing with food allergies.
        This study intends to raise public knowledge of nutritional information and enable users to make educated dietary decisions.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The overweight percentage keeps increasing in contemporary society~\cite{nihoverweightobesity} therefore more and more people care about health issues.
Unhealthy living styles are becoming increasingly common, for example, increasing the frequency of eating fast food due to the fast pace of life~\cite{worldpopulationreviewfastfood}, lack of sport activity.
Due to those reasons, suboptimal health is very common in this modern society.
So as to stay healthy or maintain weight, many people cook for themselves to restrict their calorie intake.
This growing interest in nutrition has prompted innovations in technology that can assist consumers in making informed decisions about their food intake.

In this project, we will use deep learning to present a promising solution.
We focus on the utilization of YOLOv11~\cite{redmon2016lookonceunifiedrealtime} (You Only Look Once), a popular object detection model known for its speed and accuracy, to identify various food items images and estimate their calorics and check for allergen information.
By using the detection feature of YOLOv11, we aim to modify the model that can provide nutritional values and check the allergens for food detected in the input image.

This project allows users to input images of foods and the project will output feedback of estimated calories and potential allergens.
This introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the methodology, results, and implications of our findings in the subsequent sections of this project.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

TODO!!

WRITE THAT WE'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S ENOUGH?

\subsection{Technical approach}

Our first idea about approaching this problem was using one of the simple well-known image classification models (ResNet~\cite{he2015deepresiduallearningimage} or even more accurate XCeption~\cite{chollet2017xceptiondeeplearningdepthwise}).
However, since they only attribute one label to one image, we later decided using object detection model instead (also well-known YOLO in particular).
That would allow us training our model on simpler datasets, containing only basic products instead of including all different meal combinations.
For instance, consider a meal consisting of a bowl of rice and a pork chop.
In case of using image classification models, either we would have to include "bowl of rice with pork chop" into our dataset, or that image will be classified not precisely (probably as rice if there is more rice in the image).
On the contrary, if we use object detection model, we would be able to detect "rice" and "pork chop" separately and then proceed combining detection results.

We decided to use transfer learning technique (advised by ultralitics team themselves~\cite{ultralytics2024transferlearning}) for re-using already trained YOLO model weights and not train it from scratch.
That technique includes downloading model weights after training on some general-purpose dataset (COCO~\cite{lin2015microsoftcococommonobjects} in this case), freezing several initial layers of the model (we assume that they are responsible for generic image features, similar for every domain), so-called backbone, and training the rest, so-called head.
After the model is trained, we try to further boost accuracy using fine tuning approach (again, also described by ultralytics~\cite{ultralytics2024finetuning}).
In our case we unfreeze all the model layers, decrease the learning rate and train the model again.

The model weights are saved in \texttt{.pt} file, that can be evaluated by any language and library supporting \texttt{Torch}~\cite{torchlibrary} library.

\subsection{Intermediate Results}
